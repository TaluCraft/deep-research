# How do multi-agent AI systems actually coordinate?

Research complete. I spawned 5 parallel research agents investigating:

1. **Communication Protocols** - Found MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP forming a new interoperability stack
2. **Coordination Architectures** - Orchestrator-worker, peer-to-peer, distributed patterns with clear trade-offs
3. **Real Implementations** - Anthropic's 90.2% improvement, Google's context tiers, Microsoft's unified framework
4. **Failure Modes** - 41-86.7% failure rates, MASFT taxonomy identifying 14 distinct failure modes
5. **Emergent Behaviors** - Self-organization, ToM coordination, 10x-11,000x improvements from emergence

The synthesis reveals what no single report showed: **multi-agent coordination operates through a 4-layer stack** (protocols → architectures → state systems → emergence), and the field is at an inflection point where interoperable standards have arrived but hard problems remain unsolved.
